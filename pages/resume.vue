        In October of 2024, I was promoted to Product Software Engineer. With this promotion, I had the opportunity
        to move to a new team within UpToDate tasked with developing AI solutions using machine learning and natural
        language
        processing to improve UpToDate's search engine. Since the team change, I've been working with a skilled team of
        data scientists and software engineers to build new features to our sandbox and production environments. One
        project I'm proud of
        is the successful rollout of new features in time for the <a class="inactive-link" target="_blank"

          HLTH Conference</a> and enablement for all users across UpToDate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of current role, I am also a security champion driving impactful change across our product by
        discovering vulnerabilities
        and coordinating security upgrades. Furthermore, I participate in co-op and fulltime interviews and hope to
        drive team success by helping hire
        quality applications who would fit technically and culturally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Going into 2025, I'm excited to keep improving user experience within UpToDate by utilizing the latest
        advancements in Computer Science and
        technology. My goal is to become a better front-end engineer, as well as learn more about machine learning and
        natural language processing.

      <p>
        Right after college, I started my full time software engineering career working on the sustaining engineering
        team for UpToDate. The core responsibilities
        of the team are fixing bugs, working on small features, and being a support network for other teams. My
        experience with this team provided
        an amazing experience to become a professional software engineer. Mainly responsible for working on backend
        infrastructure, my ability to write high
        quality Java code, SQL queries, and develope architecture drastically improved. One notable project that many
        junior software engineers don't have the
        opportunity to work on was rebuilding an outdated email infrastructure. For this project, I gathered project
        requirements, met with various
        stakeholders, designed the replacement architecture from the ground up, and documented a solution for successful
        implementation and rollout.

        Coming back to MTech Systems for a second internship, I returned to the application which I had build in my
        previous internship. This time
        I added additional features and functionality to improve user experience and business efficiency. I integrated
        Power Bi report dashboards
        into the application, developed a VSCode extension which called a custom endpoint on application for quick,
        inline translations for developers,
        as well as researching and prototyping the feasibility to integrating Google Translate.

      <p class="date">2021</p>
      <p>
        In my first internship, I was tasked with creating an application which interfaced with a database of custom
        translations used by the company for
        localization efforts. I built a Blazor Web Assembly application, along with API build in asp.net, to CRUD from a
        database. Having no prior experience
        C#, Linq, Blazor, or other tools used, I had to learn while developing and successfully deployed a working
        version utilized across the business. As my
        semi-professional software engineering experience, I learned a lot about enterprise software development
        including the importance of testing, tracking work,
        adding security features, and how to work with others.

      <p>I completed my undergraduate education at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. I went to Dartmouth
        planning to study
        Computer Science, of which I completed a BA. My studies in Computer Science focused heavily on building a strong
        foundation for software engineering
        which I wanted to pursue as a career. However, the broad curriculum of the Computer Science Department allowed
        me to study not only software engineering,
        but also discrete math and algorithms, machine learning, and computer architecture, compilers, and operating
        systems. I even got to create
        a video game for my senior design project called <a class="inactive-link" target="_blank"

      </p>

      <p>
        Dartmouth focuses on providing a well rounded education, and I decided to pick up another major in Religious
        studies because
        the field let me learn about the world around me in new ways. I really enjoyed learning about African Religions,
        Buddhism,
        and Islam - religions that I hadn't been exposed to in the past. Taking on this second major was a lot of work,
        but it taught me skills like critical reading and analysis, writing, and strong communication.

        successes throughout the years on the
        team, including
        multiple Eastern Sprints medals and an IRA medal. However, what my time on the team taught me the most was grit,
        perseverance,
        and commitment to something greater than myself.
