        <p>Hello! My name is Oscar Lee.</p>
        <p>I am a Dartmouth College alumnus and live in Boston, Massachusetts, working as a product software engineer
            at <a class="inactive-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en">Wolters Kluwer</a>

            My recent projects with Wolters Kluwer include work on our generative AI and natural language processing

            I love staying fit and being outside, I rowed throughout high school and at Dartmouth College but have now turned by athletic pursuits to running.
            I recently competed at the Philadelphia Marathon.
